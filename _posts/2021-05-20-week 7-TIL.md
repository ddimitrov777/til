title: Things I learned from Week 7
---


* You can enclose a variable name aroundd brackets to create an object with a key-value pair (where the key is the variable name, and the value is the value of the variable) 
* Array desutructing to snag the values you need from arrays…
    * const [varName, …theRest] = theArray
         Creates two variables, varName and theRest, fetching their respect values from theArray (note the use of the rest operator … in theRest)
* To remove subset from an array… use .filter and ! with .includes
    * Say you have a fullArray and a subsetOneArray…
```
let subsetTwoArray = fullArray.filter( arbName => !subsetOneArray.includes(arbName));
```
* Instead of using for in loops for iterating through object, you can just convert the object to an array fro more methods
* .reduce() can be used in place of most (if not all) array method operations (like .map, .filter, etc.). it’s jus more verbose….
    * So why use it? …. it comes in handy when you have chain of array methods… you can replace the chain with just a reduce method

* A useful walk through example of objects being flexible arrays and using .reduce
    * Say you wanted to retrieve users who had age >20
    
Object.entries(users).reduce( () => {}, **[]**);

Object.entries(users).reduce( (**acc, []**) => {}, []);

// we’re using array restructuring in the item input variable

Object.entries(users).reduce( (acc, [**id, user**]) => {}, []);

/

Look at the above snippet…
Id will correspond with the first part of that sub array
user will correspond with the object, {name: “Fred”, age: 17}
Here we are assigning names to it

/

Object.entries(users).reduce( (acc, [id, user]) => {
**	if (user.age > 20) {
		acc.push(); 
	}**
}, []);

//supply a condition, push it to the accumulator array

Object.entries(users).reduce( (acc, [id, user]) => {
	if (user.age > 20) {
		acc.push(** { …user, id}** ) ;
	}
	**return acc;**
}, []);

// push through an object, also make sure to return the accumulator

* Migration files require a specific naming convention… just use rails generate migration
    * Also, there is a particular way to enable citext, namely, to send the enable ‘cutest’ through a migration (see postgresql site)
