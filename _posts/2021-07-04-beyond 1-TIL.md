* For case statement in .html.erb, the first part must be
```
<% case thing
when “value” %>
```

NOT 
```
<% case thing %>
<% when “value %>
```

* Validates inclusion (to validate for changing of specific field)
    * e.g. 
```
validates :student_id,
            inclusion: { in: ->(i) { [i.student_id_was] }, message: "cannot be changed. Create a new lesson instead" },
            on: :update 
```

This makes it so you can’t change student ID for the lesson that's booked (this was in my lesson.rb model)

* local_variables.include?(:var_name) to check if variable is defined (can be useful for erors as well)
* Custom validation where there is a scope and a conditional that acts like a scope on an enum

```
validates :start_time, uniqueness: { scope: :instructor_id,
    message: "is already booked" ,  if: -> { self.scheduled? } } 
```
In the above, remember that we have enum status, where "scheduled" is an option.

     
* If an error happens… it gets put in the model object’s .errors array…
    * e.g. @lesson.errors
    * It’s an array of hashes… where you have :field_name => error message..
    * e.g. @lesson.errors[:start_time] returns that error message
    * You can also do @lesson.errors.full_messages… to get a full sentence of the error message with the field… 
         Check for more methods at https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Errors 
    * You can messages to the :base attribute
* Remove brackets and quotes (like in error message with array)
```
.gsub(/("|\[|\])/, "")
```
