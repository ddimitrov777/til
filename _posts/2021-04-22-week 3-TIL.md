# Photogram Industrial 2


*  .pluck method
A shortcut for:
e.g.

```
Person.pluck(:name)
```
Is the same as
```
Person.all.map(&:name)
```

Which is saying:
SELECT people.name FROM people

*  ||= the conditional assignment operator

 a ||= b means
If a is undefined or falser, then evaluate b and set a to the result.  On the other hand, if a is defined and evaluates to truth, then b is not evaluated and no assignment takes place

It’s almost like a || a = b

Except that it doesn’t through NameError

* Scopes using the these lambda shorthands

e.g.
```
scope :past_week, -> {where(created_at: 1.week.ago...) }
```

So you can then have
Photo.past_week (I think)

* Enum column type kind of works like a data validation dropdown in excel can set such a variable with “!”
In a model.rb file
```
enum status { pending: "pending", rejected: "rejected", accepted: "acccepted"}

```
Now we can get a variety of helpful methods using "?" and "!"
like

```
follow_request.accepted?    # => returning true or false

follow_request.accepted!    # => setting the status to "accepted" and saves

```

We also get automatic positive and negative scopes
like

```
FollowRequest.accepted
current_user.received_follow_requests.not_rejected
```

We can use this further in things like has_many statements

```
has_many :accepted_sent_follow_requests, -> { where(status: “accepted”) }
```

This 
** -> {where(status)} **
Allows us to inject a filter into this association method
